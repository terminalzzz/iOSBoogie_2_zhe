Boogie 2 Project

This project will require a good amount of personal research ability.
We have NOT covered everything related to this project in class.

1. Find the MyIcons.zip file in the folder structure
2. Unarchive it
3. Import the images into XCode and then put them in a table view along with the title of the file as the name
4. When I tap on a cell, the cell should highlight then deselect



HINTS:
1. Google: "How to add images to XCode"
2. Google: "How to show images in UITableViewCells"
3. Google: "How to deselect a highlighted table view cell"
